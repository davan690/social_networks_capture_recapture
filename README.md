# Inferring animal social networks from capture-recapture data 

This repository contains `R` codes to reproduce the analyses in a paper about to be submitted hopefully that aims to infer animal social networks from capture-recapture data. There are two directories. The directory `dolphin_case_study` contains codes for the real case study on Commerson's dolphin data and is used, among others, to produce Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2. The directory `simulations` is used to asses the bias in parameter estimates.
